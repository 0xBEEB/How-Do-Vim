# How Do Vim

## An introductory primer on vi and vim

Briar Rose Schreiber 2016

This project is a couple of files I use in a short vim talk for those who are
new to console editors. Vi and its improved successor, vim, can be daunting to
learn. I have given the talk about six times to incoming freshmen in a
University Computer Science program and a very large majority of the students
continued to use vim afterwards. This talk is hands on, and you should have a
computer with you when you attend.
